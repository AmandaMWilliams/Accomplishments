# TCP Git Conflict Resolution

## Overview
* Project
* Scenerio
* Actions Taken
* Outcome

### Project
TCP clone "Quack" - group project

### Scenerio
The back-end of our project was not communicating with Postman as expected. A group member created a whole new back-end based on an online tutorial. The group decided to adopt this code as the new back-end for our project.

### Actions Taken
I removed the existing back-end code from the Git-Hub repo, and imported the new code. Upon inspection, the imported code was incomplete. I advised the group member who created the code to merge his dev branch to his master branch. Then replaced the incomplete code with the completed code.

### Outcome
My group members were able to pull the new back-end code successfully from our existing GitHub repository.
